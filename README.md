# dk_mac_fixed-layout

Danish Mac keyboard layout based on a late 2011 Macbook Pro (A1278 and A1286.)

All Shift and Alt keys are mapped identically to the original MacOS layout.

The "Apple" symbol requires the character to be defined in the font you are using.

Thanks to https://github.com/Tyilo/ for the original layout file and install script.
